Why I write code? What effect would I like my work to have?

I want to make computing, software, and information more accessible. 

Hardware through things like what we currently do at Neverinstall,
running software on our resources and streaming them to users, so
 the software can be utilized irrespective of a user's operating system, 
or the hardware on which it runs (access to computing).

Accessibility of software, primarily, by making said software run in
the browser itself, particularly with tech like WASM. Imagine still
 uploading images to the random servers on the cloud to convert them from
.PNG to .JPG, or to convert a .docx to a .pdf, thats 2010!

Accessibility of information... a by-product of the above two, and
the reason why I want hardware and software to be more accessible -- 
but more than that, information in and of itself. Could some piece
of information be represented more clearly? Or communicated more 
effectively? How do we scale the presentation of that piece 
of information so more people can benefit from it?

What _work_ do I do outside of "programming"?

what I'm probably listening to?
